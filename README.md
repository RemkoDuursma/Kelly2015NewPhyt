### Analysis and figures for Kelly et al. 2015 (New Phytologist, in revision)


This repository contains the raw data and R code to produce Figures 1-6.

You need to install the following R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("doBy","plantecophys","broom","reporttools"), dependencies=TRUE)
```

Then you should be able to do:

```r
source("run.R")
```

which produces six figures as PDF in `output/figures` subdirectory.
